## Overview

Within this repository you will find several sections representing the development experiences in TensorFlow that I have experienced.

Sections

- **Colaboratory**: here you can find some experiences represented in Colaboratory, the simplicity and flexibility of the tool make the development of examples and tests directly in the cloud proposed by Google very attractive.

- **Jupyter**: here you can find some examples in a pure Jupyter format, these examples often need some libraries and elements that are not totally compatible with Colaboratory and that require a traditional local environment.

- **experiences**: these experiences are directly related in an ebook where I’m also including academic content on many of these concepts related to TensorFlow and Machine Learning.

- **Python scripts and their tests**: there are some python scripts that represent simple practices on TensorFlow. These will be migrated promptly to order them in a specific section.

- Experiences explained in Medium articles:
  
  - "custom_model_object_detection" where it is proposed, the generation of a personalized model for the detection of soccer players, specifically the article shows the experience with Lionel Messi.
  - "tie_dominant_color" This experience uses an object detection model and trims elements to then analyze its color and deliver options to the developer.
